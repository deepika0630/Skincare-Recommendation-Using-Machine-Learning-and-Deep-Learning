# Skincare-Recommendation-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning

Overview

In response to the growing demand for facial skincare products, fueled by economic growth and an aging population, the Virtual Skincare Advisor aims to simplify and enhance the skincare selection process. With a diverse array of available products often leaving consumers confused and fatigued, this system provides a personalized solution to mitigate the risks associated with using inappropriate skincare items. By leveraging advanced machine learning and deep learning models, this project delivers tailored product recommendations based on users' unique skin characteristics.

Features

Selfie Analysis Module: Users submit selfies for detailed facial feature extraction using computer vision algorithms.

Efficient Net: A state-of-the-art deep learning model for accurate skin type, tone, texture analysis, and identification of skin concerns such as acne and wrinkles.

Skin Metrics Inference Engine: Processes extracted facial features to derive unique skin metrics for each user.

Correlates these metrics with skincare needs using machine learning models.

Product Recommendation System: Generates a curated list of skincare products based on inferred skin metrics, offering a personalized approach to skincare routines.

How It Works

User Input: Users upload a selfie through the user interface.

Image Analysis: The Selfie Analysis Module processes the image to extract facial features.

Skin Metrics Derivation: The Skin Metrics Inference Engine interprets the data to derive unique skin metrics.

Recommendation Generation: Based on these metrics, the Product Recommendation System suggests a list of suitable skincare products.
